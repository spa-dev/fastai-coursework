# fastai-coursework

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks modified as coursework for fastai Practical Deep Learning for Coders. The notebooks contain personal notes and modifications as part of the assigned 'homework' for each lesson.

Some notebooks are also published on my GitHub Pages [blog](https://spa-dev.github.io/fastai.html) with more accurate rendering.

See [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) for lessons and links to the original notebooks.
